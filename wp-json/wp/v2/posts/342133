The cup is inspired by a magical land from motifs such as flashing yellow lights, merry-go-rounds, pine trees, stars, gift boxes, Santa Claus, reindeer, signature bells, and beautiful snowmen. These sparkling details are all perfectly sketched to create a meaningful and warm story during the holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>Previously, in the 2022 Christmas season, the brand also launched an impressive Christmas cup design with a red interface mixed with green, which is the typical colour of Christmas.

When consumers perceive a product as being available only for a specific season or holiday, it can generate a sense of urgency and drive them to make a purchase sooner rather than later. By leveraging this psychological effect, you can create a perceived value for your products and motivate consumers to take action, Ms Van Le Chief Marketing Officer said.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_342136\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-342136\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-342136 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Hinh-so-4-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Hinh-so-4-768x1024.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Hinh-so-4-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Hinh-so-4-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Hinh-so-4-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Hinh-so-4-600x800.jpg 600w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/01\/Hinh-so-4.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-342136\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Seasonal packaging creates a sense of limited-time exclusivity, which can be a powerful motivator for consumers<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>Packaging production costs is strategic investment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In reality, just a few brands in the F&amp;B sector in Vietnam devote as much effort and cost to packaging design as ToCoToCo.<\/p>\n<p>ToCoToCo is aware of the importance of changing seasonal packaging in business efficiency. Brainstorming for new packaging for the festive seasons, such as Christmas and New Year, becomes an important part of ToCoToCo\u2019s marketing strategy, at which the design team puts many dedication to make their brand distinctive in the context of the strict competition of the F&amp;B sector in general and the bubble tea segment in particular.<\/p>\n<p>According to ToCoToCo, in a crowded marketplace, standing out from the competition is crucial. Seasonal packaging offers a unique opportunity to differentiate your products from those of your competitors. By investing in seasonal design elements, brands can create packaging that is distinct and memorable, helping their products capture consumers\u2019 attention and stay top-of-mind. When consumers encounter a sea of similar products, the one with seasonal packaging that evokes positive emotions and associations is more likely to be selected. This differentiation can create a competitive edge and contribute to increased sales.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at the international market, European and American brands are gradually taking over Asian brands thanks to smart long-term business strategies. They realise that holiday packaging not only serves a short-term business campaign but also a long-term business strategy. Before each festival season, the big guys usually prepare at least 2-3 months. The first step is promotion, then media campaigns, and finally sales. Unique packaging investment research helps businesses effectively implement strategies in each business stage. Increase opportunities to exceed sales and reach sustainable potential markets.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCreating seasonal packaging can be an effective strategy for boosting sales and enhancing brand visibility. Seasonal packaging refers to the practice of designing and producing unique product packaging that aligns with specific seasons or holidays throughout the year,\u201d Ms Van Le Chief Marketing Officer said.<\/p>\n<p>Hotline: 1900 63 69 36<\/p>\n<p>Website: https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Not only drawing attention with a diverse menu, the national bubble tea brand ToCoToCo captivates Gen Z with innovative and distinctive seasonal packaging designs with meaningful messages, shaping the brand [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":342137,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[26,27],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.5 -
