There is no denying that young people possess abundant amounts of energy but it diminishes very quickly. Pressure from study, work or stress from relationships causes young people to face fatigue, anxiety, and even burn-out.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, in recent years, the concept of &#8220;healing&#8221; has gained significant traction among the youth in Vietnam, reflecting a broader societal shift towards prioritizing mental health and emotional well-being. This trend, while offering many benefits, also presents challenges for companies and workers in the country.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_353612\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-353612\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-353612 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Hinh-1-3-1024x596.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Hinh-1-3-1024x596.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Hinh-1-3-300x175.jpg 300w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Hinh-1-3-768x447.jpg 768w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Hinh-1-3-600x349.jpg 600w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Hinh-1-3.jpg 1504w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-353612\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">ToCoToCo&#8217;s R&amp;D team look for high-quality material region to create cups of tea with best quality<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The rise in popularity of healing activities such as meditation, sound therapy, and travel among Vietnamese youth can be attributed to the pressures of modern life, including work stress and personal issues.<\/p>\n<p>Along with outside activity, many young people have a habit of drinking tea at the office to feel cool down. They think that having a nice cup of green tea every morning is a great way to relieve\u00a0stress\u00a0and boost your brain function, hence they will often easily learn to balance their lives, have a better life, both mentally and physically.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe also observe the image of young people and officers sharing their quiet moments with a cup of green tea, which is a way to help them regain their spirit and concentrate on work.

Green tea\u2019s l-theanine works by way of nerve cell receptors for\u00a0GABA, glutamate, and other neurotransmitters, and has calming effects. It helps to increase\u00a0dopamine\u00a0and the production of alpha waves in the brain, which create a pleasant, relaxed state.<\/p>\n<p>In clinical research, l-theanine has been found to help boost attention, mood, cognition, and even\u00a0quality of sleep. However, it doesn\u2019t diminish alertness.<\/p>\n<p>Green tea\u2019s caffeine works well with l-theanine to enhance brain function, including mood, vigilance, reaction time, and memory. Some people have a more even, focused energy that allows for better productivity when they drink green tea, compared with coffee, which has about three times the amount of caffeine.<\/p>\n<p>Green tea also contains an amino acid called L-theanine, which has been found to help reduce stress and boost your mood. Research shows that the combination of caffeine and L-theanine\u00a0improves brain function by strengthening working memory and attention, and reducing anxiety.<\/p>\n<p>With several benefits, savouring a cup of jasmine tea has the potential to provide the required strength to go through a bustling day, contributing to a holistic feeling of wellness and cognitive balance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Organic jasmine green tea: drinks good for your health<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jasmine green tea is the perfect combination of high-quality green tea leaves and jasmine flowers. Tea is fermented and blended with jasmine, this process is repeated many times to make tea sweet-smelling like jasmine. Jasmine tea is yellow, with the sweetness of jasmine and bitterness of tea, creating a refreshing and relaxing feeling for users.<\/p>\n<p>According to ToCoToCo\u2019s study, another key factor in managing a 12-hour workday is having a good night\u2019s sleep. While on first thought, the idea of a caffeinated beverage\u00a0helping\u00a0with sleep sounds impossible. However, studies have shown that green tea can promote both the quality of\u00a0sleep\u00a0and the quantity.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_353613\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-353613\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-353613 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/2-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/2-1024x768.png 1024w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/2-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/2-768x576.png 768w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/2-1536x1152.png 1536w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/2-2048x1536.png 2048w, https:\/\/tocotocotea.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/2-600x450.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-353613\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jasmine green tea lies a beautiful fusion of two unique ingredients namely fragrant jasmine flowers and delicate green tea leaves<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The reason is simple because theanine works to reduce stress-related hormones and neuron excitement in the brain, it helps the brain to relax.

These antioxidants are known to combat oxidative stress, which is a key contributor to the development of heart disease.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to protecting heart health, you should first consider working on cholesterol balance. Some research suggests that the compounds in jasmine tea, particularly catechins, can help reduce levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The harmonious blend between jasmine and green tea. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Vietnamese jasmine green is an incredibly fragrant blend- one may even call it the queen of jasmine teas. Traditionally, Vietnamese prefer their tea green, either straight or naturally scented with flowers. This fine organic jasmine green tea was scented traditionally by layering jasmine blossoms between fresh harvested green tea leaves repeatedly.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGreen Organic jasmine tea is not only appealing to the senses but also contains many healthy nutrients such as antioxidants, vitamin C, and amino acids.
